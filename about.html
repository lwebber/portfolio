    <p>I spent the first half of my career in education, teaching middle school and high School English and History. I caught the technology bug early on when laptops started showing up in the classroom and became an ed tech pioneer. I taught myself to code
        when my school needed a Computer Science teacher and after that, I was full-on addicted to code. I’m currently a student in Bloc’s Web Development Apprenticeship program.</p>
    <p>To me, code is one of the most beautiful ( and almost spiritual) expressions of human ingenuity. I am awed and humbled by how the human brain can compose and transcribe abstract symbols capable of effecting so much growth and change in our civilization.
        Just. Wow. I’m eager to connect with other people and organizations putting the “code-wow’ factor to work towards the betterment of humanity. Contact me <a href="mailto: hello@lwebber.dev">here.</a></p>
    <p>Outside of my life as a coder, I’m a semi-professional actress in the Bay Area and have considerable experience with mindfulness meditation, organizational development coaching, cooking, and outdoor adventures.</p>
